### Introduction

This is a very short blog post on my general research as part of "DYOR" (do your own research), 

The "research" I do basically is a checklist of things I go over to decide if something is worth investing into or not.

**As a quick reminder, crypto is incredibly volatile and risky. Don't risk anything you can't afford to lose! ðŸ˜­**


### Prerequisites

You should already know the basics of crypto, such as how to buy crypto, how NFTs work and ideally already own some crypto and are comfortable with the feeling of losing 30% value in a few hours.

### Step 1 - Avoiding scams and retaining our money

Making money is fine, but if you lose money then your future investments have to gain way more to recover, e.g if you have $100 to invest and lose $50 to a scam, then your remaining $50 has to get 100% gians to even be back even, which is not easy. So we must avoid losing money wherever possible.

Similar applies to fees, I personally avoid Ethereum entirely because of this, the fees are simply too high to justify anything, for example if you buy a $150 NFT you may have to pay $100 extra in fees, meaning your NFT has to double in value to make any profit at all.

You can start out by doing a basic bit of research and plug any coin into a website that checks if the coin is a scam such as [isthiscoinascam](https://isthiscoinascam.com/), an example of something to avoid is [snowdog](https://isthiscoinascam.com/check/snowdog) which was a recent very big rug pull that scammed people out of ~$30m.

No whitepaper, no project team listed, no github, a totally anonymous project that promised huge gains if you handed your money over, not much of a surprise that once it "mooned" all of a sudden it was worthless.

However, things get tricky when you find a project that is not open source and may be listed as risky despite the information being there if you do some of your own research, a good example is [Gods Unchained](https://isthiscoinascam.com/check/gods-unchained). 




**This is where the research starts**:

- Can you find the team on LinkedIn?
- Is the project ran by a company? If so How reputable is that company? 
- Are the employees reputable?
- Is the company hiring? How many employees do they have?

If you **can't** find this information then things are looking really bad already, I'd personally stop here immediately. A huge amount of scams are ran by anonymous teams.


**If you've found some info and the team looks good**:
- Check their social links, how many followers do they have and what's the engagement like? A twitter profile with 100k followers should be getting a decent amount of likes on every tweet.
- Do they have a discord channel? Are people active? What are the vibes you get in the discord? Many of them are empty wastelands or full of bots typing similar comments, avoid those ones.
- Does it look like a Ponzi scheme? Are there channels to gain points by inviting others, a huge red flag is where a project will provide you "points" for proving you've posted an ad to another community.



**By now you should have weeeded out a huge amount of scams and we can move on to deeper things like polish and if the project even actually has any kind of value.**

### Step 2 - Actual value of the project

We've found a real project, the team is visible online and things are transparent and ideally they have a fair release system that will allow us to join in. Now we need to figure out if the project is even making anything people will care about.

If we go to the [Gods Unchained website](https://godsunchained.com/) you'll be greeted with a highly polished website, a "Play now" button, gameplay examples and examples of the "tokenomics", basically an example of **why** the project even needs to include crypto at all. In the case of Gods Unchained, it is because they want to allow players to trade cards.

Now we have to look at the project is currently looking like, in the case of a very new project you have to lower expectations down to an MVP where it may only have the absloute basics in place. 


**We need to now find out how the project sums up**

**For games:**
  - Is the game playable in any way currently? If it isn't released yet then the risk is huge, art can be deceptive on unreleased projects
    - Does the game **look** good, is the art okay, or does it look like a game from 2005 made in Unity using default game assets?
  - What platforms is the game on? Just web? Does it work on a mobile browser?
    - If the game is only available on a single platform (e.g android or windows only) this is a big red flag, unless it is an MVP state and they have plans to release on other platforms later.
    - If the game is desktop only this can hurt adoption, especially if the game is a typical mobile-type game but being played on desktop
  - How will we actually make money?
    - Does the game have some sort of "breeding" or generating of tradeable assets? What is the value of them?
    - What is the cost to get started? Is it in your budget? A majority of crypto games require ~$100 or more investment to begin playing
    - Does the game have a long-term plan? Will you have to "time the market" or can you see it as a long-term investment to hold things for the future?


  **For NFTs:**
  - Does the NFT have any utility? If not it is just a jpeg and is simply art, no utility NFTs typically drop off rapidly and are hold to sell once the hype dies down.
  - Can you get in on the original release minting? If not, can you get near the mint price on the secondary market? If not it might be worth skipping.
   - Typically NFTs double in price almost immediately after minting on a secondary market, however, they can often rise way more than 2x and slowly crash back down to 2x - if you buy at over 2x mint price you can lose money this way.

  

  **For coins:**
  - Does the coin actually solve a problem and need to be a new cryptocurrency?
  - [Is it a shitcoin?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBnWQRs1bPQ)
  - Do you think the coin will exist 1 year from now? Maybe 2 years? Check the list of popular coins from ~2 years ago and only a few very popular coins are still around.

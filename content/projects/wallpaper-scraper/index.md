This is a script that scrapes the popular wallpaper site [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/), it will ask some user input and search options, then it will scrape and download all of the images that match the search options.

It keeps track of history to avoid re-downloading the same images, and has a very easy to use UI that features sliders, option pickers where you can use the arrow keys to navigate and select options.

## ü•≥ How to add a blog or project

- Create a folder under /blog e.g `new-blog-post`
- Add a markdown file to generate a page `index.md`
- Include some frontmatter to the top of the file to give info about the page:

  ```
    ---
    title: How to use DigitalOcean Spaces as a CMS # title to display
    date: 2020-11-08T18:14:47.654Z # new Date() - recent posts are marked with new
    type: digitalocean # which icon to use, e.g digitalocean = digitalocean.svg inside content/assets/
    action: copy # copy = copy button on code blocks, code = runs code on code blocks
    ---
  ```

- Add images if you wish into the folder and use them in the markdown e.g `![public](./public.png)`
- Visit the blog page and see the new post at the top of the list

The same can be done for a project, except into the `/projects` folder:

- A project also has a preview, so add `image: "./preview.jpg"` to the frontmatter and include a preview image in the folder
- A project can also be featured (on the top carousel): add `featured: true` or `featured: false` to the frontmatter

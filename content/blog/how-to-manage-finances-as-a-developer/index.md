### Introduction

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **The information found here is primarily focused on UK-based saving and investing** but should apply generally also, for some things I will explain further how it relates to the UK specifically.

- ðŸ’° This is a blog post that will cover all of the main stages of sorting out your finances, assuming you are starting early on or have not started thinking about saving & investing yet.

### Step 1 - Budgeting and understanding what you want to achieve

Before you jump too far ahead you have to take some time and think about your income in relation to your expenses, what your goals are and what you really want to achieve. Assuming this is being read.

This can vary quite a lot depending on person to person, but a few main rules apply to a majority of people and luckily for us people have already spent time creating flow charts and basic guides for us. 

For people in UK I highly recommend checking out the [UKPersonalFinance flowchart](https://ukpersonal.finance/flowchart/), following the flowchart makes it quite easy to figure out where you're currently at and what next steps you can take.

### What your payslip means and how you can get more for your money

We'll start off by looking at our payslip and figuring out our income and how we can optimise that before we even start budgeting. This will give us a good base to start from and we'll know exactly how much money we'll have each month as well as how retirement will generally look.


You may have heard things such as "40% tax over Â£50k" and other things that sound scary on the surface.

It is also a common misconception that earning Â£49,999 could be better than earning Â£50,001 - that is not how it works, it's on a sliding scale. 

The higher tax brackets **actually** mean *"income over Â£50,000 is taxed at 40%"*. 

If you're in this bracket, or higher, you should begin looking at ways to reduce your salary to minimimse your tax losses on your income, anything under that salary band is still taxed at 20%.

There are a few ways you can reduce your income in order to lower the amount of higher-rate tax you pay, the easiest and best option would be to increase your pension contributions, meaning you can contribute Â£5000/year to your pension, which will then reduce your salary for Â£50,000 and all of that income will be taxed at the regular rate.



**Example:**

You earn Â£55,000/year. Â£5000 of that will be taxed at the higher rate of 40%, so you will be losing 20% more to taxes on that Â£5,000. 


- Annual net income: **~Â£41,130**
- Monthly net income (incl NI): **~Â£3425**
- Amount lost to higher rate tax per year: **~Â£1,500**
- Overall income including pension: **~Â£41,130**


If you were to put 1% annual income (Â£550) into your pension you would recieve Â£220 of tax relief (40%).

This means we want to keep increasing the percentage we pay into our pension until the tax relief is no longer giving us 40% tax relief.

This is roughly ~7%.

Meaning our new, no longer higher rate tax paying income would look like this:

- Pension yearly (7%): **Â£3,850***
- Annual net income: **~Â£38,796**
- Monthly net income (incl NI): **3,233**
- Amount lost to higher rate tax per year: **Â£0**
- Overall income including pension **~Â£42646**

By doing this our net worth per year is increased by roughly Â£1500 that we now avoid paying at the higher tax rate.

You can also look into other ways if they're available, such as **salary sacrifice schemes** (e.g bike to work scheme) that can reduce your overall income, which also would lower your national insurance payments due to the lower salary. However if you don't need the scheme you sign up for then it would be better to simply use a pension.
